Changing the world, one version at a time!

## [BlackCoinâ€™s Proof-of-Stake Protocol v2](https://blackcoin.org/blackcoin-pos-protocol-v2-whitepaper.pdf)
> The  current  Proof  of  Stake  protocol  has  severalpotential  security  issues:  coin  age  can  be  abused  by  maliciousnodes to gain significant network weight to perform a successfuldouble  spend.  Additionally,  due  to  coin  age,  honest  nodes  canabuse  the  system  by  staking  only  on  a  periodical  basis.  Thisdoes  not  secure  the  network.  Lastly:  in  the  current  system  allcomponents  of  a  stake  of  proof  are  predictable  enough  to  allowpre-computation of future proof-of-stakes. In this paper a systemis  proposed  to  solve  said  issues.
