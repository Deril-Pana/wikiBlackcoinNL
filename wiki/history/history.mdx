### [Interview with the Creator of Blackcoin (BC)](https://web.archive.org/web/20140603183808/http://www.followthecoin.com/interview-creator-blackcoin-bc/)

> Blackcoin is a scrypt based coin launched on February 24th, 2014 with no pre mine (neither the creator, or anyone else in the crypto community, had mined it before launch). Immediately after launch the coin garnered an impressive 20 – 28GH/s in mining power from the community, a tremendous amount of resources for a coin just being introduced to the market.

> The main reason for creating BlackCoin is to show the crypto community my view of a future coin. Not everyone in the crypto community agrees that BlackCoin’s way of disabling PoW is stable and secure. This should be proven by long-term practice.

> BlackCoin is primarily a ‘store of value’ for much of it’s holders.
