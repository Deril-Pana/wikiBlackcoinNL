Immediately after launch the coin garnered an impressive 20 – 28GH/s in mining power from the community, a tremendous amount of resources for a coin just being introduced to the market.

> Not everyone in the crypto community agrees that BlackCoin’s way of disabling PoW is stable and secure. This should be proven by long-term practice.

> BlackCoin is primarily a ‘store of value’ for much of it’s holders.
