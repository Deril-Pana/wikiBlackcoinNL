I was thinking on create a token on top of Blackcoin and distibute it with BLK stakers, new users, exchanges, investors and marketing campains to promote BLK and the token with a secondary economy.
The best way for kids to learn something is playing with and enthusiasm as the best way. If we are interested in share knowledge and people interaction with BLK and the blockchain world we could create the token distribution having that in mind.
Posible distribution plan
20% for the Staking wallets open at determinated block number for a period of time would be great. Maybe from determinated block number to another one. It could be from the block 3,800,000 to 4,000,000 and All the minted block generated 1,5 BLK and a number of tokens too at the same block. With that, we will be estimulating people to stake blackcoin and withdraw funds from bittrex to stake them. (today there are 15 millons aprox. of BLKs at Trex wallets) With less founds there, price will moove easily to the upside. More people will want to buy BLK to stake them and generate tokens. Market stimulus.
50% for new users to interact with "PlayBLACK"? :) The tokens could be distributed by random geolocalization points near cities. Where the user will need to moove with their phone wallet to a determinated location that appears as a flag/spot on a kind of google maps. As a game to interact with. So, the 50% of the tokens could be distributed on a entire year. Every random reward generated will be on that position for a couple of days. If nobody catch it, it will moove to a new random point of the map. Example, if 1.000 tokens are created and distributed every day, we will need 365.000 tokens for the entire year. If from that 1.000 tokens daily, just be found 800, 200 will be mooved to a new location. Maybe the tokens could be taken for users as a QR on Aumented reality (Pokemon Go Style)
10% Exchanges, Today, we have bittrex and anycoindirect as home. We would use exchanges to new investors fund all what we want to do and let the exchanges be parto of this. 10% of the tokens could will divided %2 for every exchange and %6 for the developer team on a presale campaign Maybe (%5 Exchanges/ 5% team) 
20% To distribute on marketing campaigns to generate all the movement and interaction at socials for the next years.
