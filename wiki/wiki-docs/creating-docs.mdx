title: Creating Docs
---

By creating a MDX file inside your `/src/docs/` folder it will be created as a page; with the path defined by the filename.
Inside all docs files you can define the following options:

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Required?</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>title</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>Page title</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>description</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>Page description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>image</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>Used for og:image</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Example:

```mdx
---
title: 'My Example'
description: 'A simple description for this page'
image: /banner.jpeg
---

Wow, this is a nice page!
```

## Embeding files

Sometimes you will need to embed well known services (like CodeSandbox, Twitter, or others...). You can simply copy-paste the link (powered by the awesome [gatsby-remark-embeder](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-embedder/)).
Make sure to check the [supported services](https://github.com/MichaelDeBoey/gatsby-remark-embedder#supported-services).

## Code Highlighting

### Title

To show the title, just add it to your code block. (e.g. `title=src/docs/example/wow.mdx  lineNumbers=true`)

```mdx title=src/docs/example/wow.mdx lineNumbers=true
Wow, this is a nice example!

It has line numbers from the `lineNumbers=true` variable!

```

## Navigation

Add your new page to the `/sidebar/sidebar.yml` file.

```yml title=sidebar.yml
# This line is commented out! 
- label: 'Home'
  link: '/'
# This item is a list of items!
- label: 'Subitems Below!'
  items:
    - label: 'Example One'
      link: '/example-one'
    - label: 'Another Example'
      link: '/another-example'
```

You can also add external links:

```yml
- label: 'GitHub'
  link: 'https://github.com/danielclough/wikiBlackcoinNL'
```
